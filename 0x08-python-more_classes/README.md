# Python OOP
# More classes and Objects

* For the case of an class attribute, if an instance is created from
  the class and the attribute gets updated, it does not change the
  class attribute.
  
  ** but if the class attribute gets updated and the intance attribute
     had not been altered, the instance attribute conforms to the new
     value. If it had otherwise been altered, it would persist to its
     alterd value

* __repr__ returns an unambiguous official string representation of an
  object instance that can be passed to eval(). Mostly used by
  developers for debugging.

* __str__ returns an unofficial, readable string representation of an
  instance
